# LondonStockAPI

System Design for MVP â€“ LondonStockAPI
Architecture:
1. Type: Layered (API, Business/Repository, Data)
2. Framework: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)
3. Database: SQL Server (via Entity Framework Core)
4. Unit Testing: xUnit and Moq

Key Components:

API Layer:
1. Exposes REST endpoints for submitting trades and retrieving stock data.
2. Uses controllers (e.g., TradesController) for request handling.
3. Input/output models use DTOs and AutoMapper for mapping.
   
Business/Repository Layer:
1. ITradeRepo and TradeRepo abstract data access.
2. Handles trade creation and stock queries (single, multiple, all).
   
Data Layer:
1. AppDbContext manages EF Core entities (Trade).
2. Database schema includes a Trades table with indexes for performance. Added non-clustered index on ticker symbol for faster retrieval
   
Caching:
  In-memory caching (IMemoryCache) for stock lookups to reduce DB load.
  
MVP Features:
1. Submit a trade (POST).
2. Get current value for a stock (GET).
3. Get all stocks (GET).
4. Get selected stocks (POST).
5. Basic in-memory caching for stock data.


Improvements
1. Introducing a business layer service ITradeEngine between API and Repository. Currently calculation stock Price in repository is tighlty coupled. Having a trade engine for calculation makes it more modular and testable. This will also helps if there is any change in the calculation.
2. Use model validation attributes and return detailed validation errors. Implement global exception handling middleware for consistent error responses.
3. Secure the end points by adding authentication and add role based access control for sensitive operations like SubmitTrade.
4. Add API versioning, to support multiple API versions to ensure backward compatibility.

Bottlenecks
1. In the production single instance of API cannot handle high concurrent requests. Need to implement horizontal auto-scaling.
2. In current solution I am using InMemory cache. When we scale our API horizontally we need centralized cache. Need to implement IDistributeCache and make use of Redis cache.
3. This application in production will be high write intensive.
